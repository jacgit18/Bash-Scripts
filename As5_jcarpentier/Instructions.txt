Part 1 (75 pts)  Write a BASH script to create a user account.  
   The script should process two positional parameters:  
      o First positional parameter is supposed to be a string with user name (e.g., user_name) 
      o Second positional parameter is supposed to be a string with user password (e.g., user_password) 

   The script should be able to process one option (use getopts command): 
      o Option -f arg_to_ot_f that will make your script direct all its output messages to file  -arg_to_ot_f 

In your script: 
--------------
   Check if option -f was passed to your script and if it has its argument arg_to_ot_f 
      o If YES, continue your script according to an option that was specified (i.e., send all output messages of your script to arg_to_ot_f)  
   Check if two positional parameters were passed to your script when it was invoked 
      o If NOT, print an appropriate message and terminate your script with error (i.e., use exit 1)  
      o If YES, continue processing both positional parameters 
   Create a new user on the Linux computer/system on which your script is running (you may have to run your script with root privileges or using sudo command to do it) 
      o User’s account should have name denoted by the first positional parameter (e.g., user_name) 
      o User’s account should have password denoted by the second positional parameter (e.g., user_password). 
        Note that when assigning a password to a user, it must be in encrypted form – research how to do it correctly) 
   Check if a new directory (e.g., user_name) was crated for the user under /home/ directory 
      o If NOT, print an appropriate message and terminate your script with error  
      o If YES, continue to the next step 
   Check if the new user was added to the list of the users by checking /etc/passwd file 
    (use grep command with user_name and find out if the line in it for the user was created) 
      o If NOT, print an appropriate message and terminate your script with error  
      o If YES, print an appropriate message that the user was successfully added and terminate your script with success 
        (i.e., use exit 0) 
      
Part 2 (20 pts) Write a short SAD program ( a set of SED instructions) that perform following 
operations on a long_file.txt file (you can download it from Blackboard -> Useful Links). Your SED program should: 
   Remove, from long_file.txt all lines starting with strings A, An and The (i.e., Capital A at the beginning of the line, 
    string An and the beginning of the line and string The at the beginning of the line)  
   Then, substitute all hyphened worlds (e.g., Unix-like, multi-user) with double hyphened words 
    (e.g., Unix-like becomes Unix—like and multi-user becomes multi--user) 2)  
   Insert current date and your name after the last line of long_file.txt 
   Save edited file as  long_file.txt.new by adding .new to the name of the file 

Part 3 (5 pts) 
   Log as a user that you created in Part 1 of the assignment using user_name and user_password. If you successfully logged 
    to the new account, write “Yes, I successfully logged in as the new user” as a note when submitting it in Blackboard.
